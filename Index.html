		<p>Use of Iterative design: <br />
We used iterative design in our project mostly when building the webpage because every time we added something new we had to test it and check if we hadn’t accidentally created new problems for ourselves. Every time we had a problem, we fixed it, tested, and repeated the process.<br /><br />Audience:<br />
Violence affects most people in their day to day life, from poor to rich people. But the people that are most susceptible to being victims of violence are younger people (18-26 years old), because these are the people that go out at night the most and take public transportation and/or walk to places. This makes them more likely to be robbed or kidnapped.<br /><br />
Persona:<br />
Woman, 23 years old, lower middle class, takes bus or walks to work/home, likes to go out with friends, works and studies, wants to change her current financial situation, she is looking for a way to reduce risks when going out or commuting somewhere.<br /><br />

<p id="principles">
		Three Principles of System Design:
</p>
<p>
Early focus on users and tasks:<br />
Making sure that the idea/solution you propose is actually what the user needs according to a study about the users their selves and possibly making the users part of the design process (Consulting potential users, interviews, demos).<br /><br />
Empirical Measurement:<br />
Testing, testing, testing. Making sure that the product is usable by the users, testing possible user manuals and analyzing the results of the tests to improve our project or if we notice that it is not what the user needs, change or modify it.<br /><br />
Iterative Design:<br />
Taking notice of the problems found in the user tests and fixing them, iterative means that it is an ongoing process that repeats itself every time you find a problem, and it makes your project better each time (Considering you made the proper corrections).<br /><br />Methodology:<br />
To develop a website, we first make a list of the necessities we are looking to solve with this website. Then we start looking for all the requirements in terms of functionality, so after that we start designing the web page. After making the design we star by adding the functionality with the programming part. At the end we look for mistakes and make corrections.<br /><br />Status:<br />
So now we are at a 85% of the project, we’ve got reunited all the information we need for the persona except for the interview with the expert, because he hasn’t had the time to give us a formal interview for our project. About the rest of the work, we’ve got it all, after the interview we just need to add it to the rest and that’s it for us.  We have made a great effort on this project, and in this second term. We learned how to use different libraries and frameworks and how to apply them. Getting all the information for the persona was hard because our problem is too big and general, so we had to put a big effort investigating.<br /><br /></p><p id="principles">Interviews:</p>
User:<br />
A neighbor of us which lives in a medium-level life quality status. She is a young woman who lives in Guadalajara. We chose her because she is a single mother and because she lives constantly fearing about her child.<br /><br />
Expert:<br />
He is a policeman from the city of Guadalajara, we consider him as an expert on this problem because he lives in a constant fight against violence. So, he has lived the problem more than average people. We haven’t made this interview due to a lack of time from the policeman<br /><br />Proposal:<br />
We compared our proposal with the team of Uriel and Jorge. After reading both proposals, both teams got to the conclusion that they are as good as the other, we offer the same service except for a pair of things. The only difference we see is that we applied the second law of simplicity by making it shorter and precise, we know that sometimes the clients don’t want to read long paragraphs. The costs in our proposal are clearer and more exact for the client to know with certainty how much will they pay.<br /><br />Responsive:<br />
If you are watching it on desktop it has no problem adapting to the screen size. On mobile devices it is still not totally responsive, so we need to make some modifications to improve the responsive>ness.</p><p id="principles">Three Laws of Simplicity:</p><p>Reduce:<br />
We decided to focus our solution to a more specific aspect of the broad problem that is violence and insecurity, so we decided to attend to the prevention aspect, meaning, giving people an idea of what areas to avoid at what times of the day so they can stay safe.<br /><br />

Organize:<br />
We organized our ideas and divided them into different aspects of the same problem. When investigating more about violence in Guadalajara we divided violence into 2 types of violence: Robberies and Homicides/Physical Attacks.<br /><br />
Time: <br />
We saved time because we properly planned the webpage building process and info beforehand. We didn’t waste time there because we weren’t fixing problems as they came, we had a clear idea and just followed it all the way through.<br /><br />Grades:<br />
André Calderón: 100, because I communicated effectively with my time mate so we were both on the same channel when planning, investigating and interviewing. I consider that I have good people skills and this helped when contacting our users and expert for feedback. We worked together during the modification process of the webpage and throughout all of the activities.<br /><br />Juan Cazarez: On this second term I think I have made a good effort. I was always working with a good attitude and delivering my parts of the project on time. For this second term I deserve a 100, for all the time and dedication put on this project and the rest of the activities.<br />
